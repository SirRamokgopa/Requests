# Requests

## Wonderlust travel website
This project was a Codecademy project, in which I learnt how to make requests to a REST API. The aim of the project was to request information from the Foursquare API and OpenWeather API to create a travel website that gives the weather and nearby attractions to a user input. I was also introduced to JavaScript's fetch, async , and await functionality.
